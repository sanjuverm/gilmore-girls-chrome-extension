This is a ReadMe to help keep track of resources I used to build the Gilmore Girls chrome extension


How to override pages (like with the opening of a new tab): https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/override

## Usage (courtesy from my ladies at Tabulous Women)

To install this extension, git clone this repo, and type 'chrome://extensions' into the Chrome omnibox. Check 'Developer mode' in the upper right hand corner of the page to enable loading unpacked extensions. Drag the <```gilmore-girls-chrome-extension```>
folder onto the page to add the extension to your browser. Doing this should also add a Browser Action with our icon in the toolbar of the current tab (make sure to enable the extension as well).
